                    I AM KNOWN TO BE A HIGHLY-ORGANIZED FRONT-END DEVELOPER, EXPERIENCED IN DESIGN AND TIME MANAGEMENT. I WRITE REUSABLE CODE BLOCKS WITH THE INSTALLATION OF NECESSARY DEPENDENCIES TO BUILD A SEAMLESS, EFFICIENT, AND USER-FRIENDLY WEBSITE. MY SKILLS HAVE BEEN VERY EFFICIENT IN BOTH UI DESIGN AND WEB DEVELOPMENT.

                    <br>
                    I IMPLEMENT AND EXECUTE MY TASK EFFECTIVELY IN A STATE TAX AUTOMATION AND ADMINISTRATION SOLUTION SYSTEM, EMPLOYING VUE.JS (JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORK) AND TAILWINDCSS (CSS FRAMEWORK) FOR BUILDING USER INTERFACES AFTER DESIGNING A USER INTERFACE WITH FIGMA. THESE ENABLED THE END USERS TO REGISTER CONVENIENTLY WITH BIOMETRIC CAPTURE AND VERIFICATION SERVICES. TAXPAYERS WERE ABLE TO FILE AS WELL AS TRACK THEIR TAX PAYMENTS AND REFUND.

                    <br>
                    MY STRENGTH COMES FROM MY ABILITY TO ESTABLISH MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS FOR A SUCCESSFUL, RESOURCEFUL, AND COLLABORATIVE TEAM. I HAVE CONTRIBUTED IMENSELY TO SUCCESSFUL PROJECTS BY WORKING WITH THE PRODUCT DESIGN TEAM TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION WORKFLOW FOR THE REVENUE CODE GENERATOR, ADMIN PORTAL, AND THE CENTRAL BILLING SYSTEM.
